|1|Rotate Matrix| You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation. |JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/01%20Rotate%20Matrix">View Code</a>|
|2|Game of Life| The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0).:Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.Any live cell|JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/description/">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of Code/commit/4ae08cd0f3b77d86f646e6bf707ae47930d728a3">View Code </a>|
|3|Set Matrix Zeroes| Given an m x n integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0s. This solution uses auxiliary boolean arrays to track affected rows and columns before updating the matrix.|JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main">View Code</a>|
|4|Median of Two Sorted Arrays|Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).|JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/">LeetCode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/04%20Median%20of%20Two%20Sorted%20Arrays">View Code</a>|
|6|Maximum SubArray|Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.Example 1:Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] Output: 6Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.|JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/description/">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/Maximum%20SubArray">View Code</a>|
|7|Valid Parentheses|Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.An input string is valid if:Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.|JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/Valid%20Parentheses">View Code</a>|
|9|ThreeSum|Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.|JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=array">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/09%20ThreeSum">View code</a>|
|10|Longese Palindromic Substring|Input: s = "babad"Output: "bab" Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer|JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/10%20Longese%20Palindromic%20Substring">View code</a>|
|12|Sort Even and Odd Indices Independently|Input: nums = [4,1,2,3] Output: [2,3,4,1] Explanation: First, we sort the values present at odd indices (1 and 3) in non-increasing order.So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [4,3,2,1]. Next, we sort the values present at even indices (0 and 2) in non-decreasing order. So, nums changes from [4,1,2,3] to [2,3,4,1].Thus, the array formed after rearranging the values is [2,3,4,1].|JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-even-and-odd-indices-independently/">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/12%20Sort%20Even%20and%20Odd%20Indices%20Independently">View Code</a>|
