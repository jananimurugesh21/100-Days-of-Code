|1|Rotate Matrix| You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation. |JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of-Code/blob/main/01%20Rotate%20Matrix">View Code</a>|
|2|Game of Life| The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0).:Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.Any live cell|JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/description/">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of Code/commit/4ae08cd0f3b77d86f646e6bf707ae47930d728a3">View Code </a>|
|3|Set Matrix Zeroes| Given an m x n integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0s. This solution uses auxiliary boolean arrays to track affected rows and columns before updating the matrix.|JAVA|<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/">Leetcode</a>|<a href="https://github.com/jananimurugesh21/100-Days-of-Code/tree/main">View Code</a>|
